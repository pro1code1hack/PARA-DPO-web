            <p>
              ParaDPO can conduct overview audits or deep dives into key areas
              of concern. We find that many Data Protection internal audits are
              delivered by inexperienced auditors, so we can supplement these
              processes to ensure that your organisation is robustly scrutinised
              by experts.

            <p>
              Data Governance is required over personal data. This includes
              areas such as data retention, data ownership and management of
              Data Subject Rights. ParaDPO can enhance your organisation in this
              area.

            <h2>At ParaDPO, No Client is Too Big or Small</h2>
            <p>
              Businesses today are both data-reliant and data-subservient and
              many are using the introduction of GDPR as a lever for business
              change and transformation. In the bargain, they realise that the
              efficiencies and economies of scale that can be introduced, with
              the addition of dedicated applications that make the management of
              data (both personal and operational) more controllable and
              accountable.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a need to improve your understanding on how personal
              data usage impacts your business and how it is best managed,
              please contact ParaDPO as we are confident we have the right
